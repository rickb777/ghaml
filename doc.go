Package ghaml is a go parser for a haml-like language. It's goals are to provide a HAML-like syntax for creating views with a focus on being fast and efficient.

Ghaml achieves this by compiling ghaml templates into go code, which can then be compiled into your application directly. To ease this burden, the ghaml tool can call 'go build' for you, making a near seemless replacement.

What is HAML?
Haml stands for HTML Abstraction Markup Language, a templating system originally developed for the Ruby language. Ghaml is very similar in intent, differing where it makes sense to accomodate the differences between Go and Ruby.

HAML's core principles are:

1) Markup Should be Beautiful
2) Markup Should be DRY
3) Markup Should be Well-Indented
4) HTML Structure Should be Clear

A look at a Template

  @var data   string
  @var footer string

  %html
    %head
      %title= "Hello, ", data
    %body
      %h1= "Hello, ", data

      %div
        This is child content for the div above. Note that
        HAML is space-sensitive, so all text indented at
        this level is encased in the div.

      #id_div
        You can use the # operator as a shortcut to create
        a div with the given id.

      .implicit_class
        The .operator (think of the '.' css selector') lets
        you create a div with the given class. For example
        this text will be wrapped in a div that looks like
        this: `<div class="implicit_class">...`

      %ul {type=disc, class=super}
        - for i := 0; i < 10; i++ { // arbitrary go code
          %li= "Item: ", i
        - }

      != footer

The ghaml template above illustrates many features of Ghaml templates:

Strongly-typed data type: the @var directives specify that the template accepts two parameters of type string. In practice, a struct of view content would normally be used.

Outputting tag content via the = operator is syntactically equal to the variadic parameter definition of the fmt.Print() function. Therefore variables and strings can be concatenated by separating them with commas

The - operator lets the developer execute arbitrary Go code.

Ghaml command syntax

The default workflow is to use the ghaml command in your working directory. This will compile all ghaml template, and then run the 'go build' command. Command line options are:

  -v Output verbose (as in 'some') comments on what is going on
  -clean Remove all generated *.go files
  -nogo Do not run the 'go build' command. This might be useful in a build script
